# Data Setup Producer

## Introduction

In this module, you’ll create a data setup for producer to  produce the data and sends Azure Event Hub. Using the provided command-line, you’ll produce the sensor data of Trucks. Lastly, you’ll use the dashboard to plot Trucks on the map and watch their status in real-time. In subsequent modules you’ll add functionality to analyze and persist this data and plot the Line graph dashboard to analyze the various parameter of the Truck in real-time

## Overview

The architecture for this module involves an Event Hub as a producer. Our producer is a sensor attached to a Truck which currently moving on the track. This sensor emits data for every five second including the truck’s current location, Engine Temperature, Engine RPM, Engine Load and Coolant Temperature. Our operations team can monitor these details using the dashboard.


## Implementation

In our previous module we have created Event hub and Cosmos DB. We assume that you have completed the previous module successfully, in this module we are going to FTP the producer script to emits the data on Every Five seconds
  
## 1. Data Setup for Producer

In this step you will download the script files from the link and then you need to do the required configuration to get connect with EventHub. This script files will produce the current location, Engine Temperature, Engine RPM, Engine Load & Coolant Temperature details of the Truck.

 1. Click the [link](https://github.com/iyyappan16/Azure_HereMap/blob/master/Data_Setup_Producer/Producer.zip) and download the zip file (Producer.zip) and extract it to your local machine.

	
1. Open Azure Portal home page and login with your credentials.

1. Click on **Cloud shell** to open the Azure PowerShell command-line.

1. Let’s it open the PowerShell command-line it may take few seconds to open up

1. Ensure that the command-line interface indicates its PowerShell, by default it will be in the Azure directory. We need to set location to execute our Producer script. Execute the below command to set location

                >Set-Location $home 
	
		
6. It changes the directory and it set’s the home location of the user profile

	
1. In menu tab click on Upload/Download files icon then click on upload to upload our zip file

1. Browse to the directory where you saved the Zip file locally which you have downloaded in step-1. Choose the file and Upload.

1. Once the upload is completed successfully. The you need to extract the file, for extracting it  use the below command

	            >Expand-Archive “Producer.zip”
         
        
      ![HERE Maps & Location Services Data Streams Pricing Page](Producer/5.png)
  
1. It may take few seconds to extract, after successful extraction you can verify the file by using the below command. 

              >ls
              
1. It lists the directories available in the current directory. so, you can find the unzipped/ extracted **Producer** folder.

## 2. Get Event Hub Connection String

In this you get the Event Hub connection string details and will configure with Producer script in the next step.

1. Open Azure Portal home page in New tab

1. Select **All services** on the left navigational menu.


1. Select **Event Hubs** in the **Analytics** section.

1. In the list of event hubs, select your event hub.
	
	
1. On the **Event Hubs Namespace** page, select **Shared Access Policies** on the left menu.

6. Select a **shared access policy** in the list of policies. The default one is named: **RootManageSharedAccessPolicy**. You can add a policy with appropriate permissions (read, write), and use that policy.

1. Select the **copy** button next to the **Connection string-primary key** field. Copy this key to use in the upcoming step

## 3. Event Hub Configuration

In this step you will configure the Event Hub details on the Producer script. The producer will produce the data and sends to the Azure Event Hub to store the data’s in cosmos DB. This script files will produce the current location, Engine Temperature, Engine RPM, Engine Load & Coolant Temperature details of the Truck.

1. Go back to the first window where Azure Cloud shell command line will be running

1. Navigate to the Producer directory by executing the below command

		>cd Producer

1. In menu tab click on Open editor icon, it opens the VS code text editor online

	![HERE Maps & Location Services Data Streams Pricing Page](Producer/9.png)

1. In the text editor left panel select the **Producer** folder under this find & open **index.js**

	![HERE Maps & Location Services Data Streams Pricing Page](Producer/10.png)
	
	
1. In index.js Find the variable **EVENTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING**  and replace the Eventhub connection string value which you copied in the previous Step. 

		
6. Find the variable **HERE_APP_ID** & **HERE_APP_CODE**, and replace the HERE credentials which you created in the previous module
	
	
1. After making the changes, click on more tab to save the file. Click on more tab on the right corner, click **save** to save the file. Then click on close editor to close the window.

1. Now back in to PowerShell execute the below command to validate the producer script. You can see the data’s emitting by the Trucks. By default, it produces five trucks data.

		>node index.js	
	
	![HERE Maps & Location Services Data Streams Pricing Page](Producer/12.png)
	
	
1. You can run up to 10 Trucks to emit data. You can mention the number of trucks should run at a time by mentioning in the command line. You can mention from 1 to 10.
